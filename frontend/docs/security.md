# Frontend Security

This document outlines the security considerations and implementations in the Hotel Booking System frontend application.

## Overview

Frontend security is a critical aspect of the Hotel Booking System. While the backend handles most of the security-critical operations, the frontend implements various security measures to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Authentication Security

### Token Management

- **JWT Storage**: Authentication tokens are stored in localStorage
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens have an expiration time set by the backend
- **Automatic Logout**: Users are automatically logged out when tokens expire
- **Secure Token Transmission**: Tokens are sent to the backend using the Authorization header

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: Credentials are sent over HTTPS to the backend
2. **Token Reception**: JWT token is received and stored
3. **Token Usage**: Token is included in subsequent API requests
4. **Logout**: Token is removed from storage on logout

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

The frontend supports the backend's two-factor authentication system:

- Displays OTP input form after successful password verification
- Provides clear instructions for entering the OTP
- Implements proper error handling for invalid OTPs
- Supports resending OTP if needed

## XSS Protection

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated on the client side before submission
- Input validation is also performed on the backend as the source of truth
- Special characters are properly escaped in user-generated content

### Content Security

- Vue.js automatically escapes HTML in templates to prevent XSS
- When using `v-html`, content is carefully sanitized
- External content is validated before rendering

## CSRF Protection

- The application uses JWT tokens for authentication, which are less vulnerable to CSRF
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication
- The backend implements CSRF protection for cookie-based authentication

## Secure Communication

- All API communication is done over HTTPS
- API endpoints are protected against unauthorized access
- Sensitive data is never logged to the console

## Secure Coding Practices

### Dependency Management

- Regular updates of npm packages to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use of `npm audit` to identify and fix security issues in dependencies
- Careful vetting of third-party libraries

### Error Handling

- Generic error messages are shown to users
- Detailed error information is logged securely
- Error responses from the API don't expose sensitive information

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Sensitive data is never stored in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Temporary sensitive data is kept in memory only as long as necessary
- Form fields for sensitive data (like passwords) have autocomplete disabled

## Client-Side Validation

While the backend performs all critical validations, the frontend implements client-side validation for better user experience:

- Form inputs are validated for format and content
- Feedback is provided immediately to users
- Complex validation rules are synchronized with backend requirements

Example of client-side validation:

```javascript
const validatePassword = (password) => {
  const errors = []
  
  if (password.length < 8) {
    errors.push('Password must be at least 8 characters long')
  }
  
  if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one uppercase letter')
  }
  
  if (!/[a-z]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one lowercase letter')
  }
  
  if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one number')
  }
  
  if (!/[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(password)) {
    errors.push('Password must contain at least one special character')
  }
  
  return errors
}
```

## Payment Security

For payment processing, the frontend:

- Redirects users to the secure Zarinpal payment gateway
- Never processes or stores payment information directly
- Verifies payment status through secure backend channels
- Displays clear confirmation of payment status to users

## Security Headers

The application is configured to use secure HTTP headers when deployed:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' api.example.com; img-src 'self' data:;
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

These headers are configured in the Nginx configuration for production deployment.

## Security Testing

The frontend undergoes regular security testing:

- Static code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Manual testing of authentication and authorization flows
- Penetration testing in production-like environments

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Never Trust User Input**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data**: Don't log sensitive information or expose it in the UI
3. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update npm packages to patch security vulnerabilities
4. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**: Components should only have access to the data they need
5. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Don't expose detailed error messages to users
6. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API communication
7. **Secure Authentication**: Implement secure authentication practices
8. **Regular Security Reviews**: Regularly review code for security issues

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Immediately report the incident to the security team
2. Document the nature and scope of the incident
3. Assist in investigating the root cause
4. Implement necessary fixes and preventive measures
5. Update documentation and security practices as needed
